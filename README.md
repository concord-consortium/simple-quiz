This app is just to demonstrate how the [concord portal](https://github.com/concord-consortium/rigse) can connect to external system.

It has one model called Respose that represents a users answer to a fixed question.

It also had Devise authentication. You can sign up at:
http://localhost:3001/users/sign_up
